# Jvav-multi
It's just a joke, but we still made it. The joke was originally brought by Zhang Haoyang.
It's reprints comply with the CC3.0 protocol. (Dobby233Liu: upgraded to CC-4.0-BY)

This is a try to make Jvav REPL have a fragmented i18n system, wonderfully split, and make upgrading JRE-less.

# Building
## Linux (Ubuntu)
Bring a pack of build essentials (make, g++ is the requirement), then run `make`.
## Windows x-compile on Linux (Ubuntu) \[unsure. Jvav-multi might not work on Windows\]
Also get a Windows build toolchain, ensure libcurl includes is installed \[if doing in windows, take some hacks to global libs\], make `make` run the correct CXX, then run `make`. Copy DLL(s) if needed.
